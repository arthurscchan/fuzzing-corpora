# strongSwan Fuzzing Corpora
Corpora for fuzzing parts of the strongSwan code base

- **certs**: X.509 certificates, initially 1000 files, half of them in DER and half of them im PEM format (obtained from certificate-transparency.org)
- **credmgr_chain**: Inputs for fuzz_credmgr_chain, initially 20 files. Each consists of a 1-byte selector (encoding online flag and peer-id index) followed by an X.509 certificate (sampled from the certs corpus) which is fed to credential_manager's chain validation through create_trusted_enumerator / create_public_enumerator. The companion dictionary `credmgr_chain.dict` provides selector byte values, X.509 extension OIDs (basicConstraints, nameConstraints, CRLDistributionPoints, AIA, EKU), signature-algorithm OIDs and ASN.1 structural tokens.
- **crls**: X.509 CRLs, initially 190 files in DER format, four in PEM format, one empty and five HTML error pages (obtained from certificates from certificate-transparency.org)
- **ids**: Identification strings/blobs, initially 21 identities from the strongSwan unit tests
- **ike**: IKE protocol messages, initially 10 files covering IKEv2 with various exchange types, derived from the strongSwan unit tests
- **ocsp_req**: OCSP requests, initially 2 files in DER format derived from the strongSwan KVM regression tests
- **ocsp_rsp**: OCSP responses, initially 4 files in DER format derived from the strongSwan KVM regression tests
- **pa_tnc**: RFC 5792 PA-TNC messages, initially 18 messages derived from the strongSwan KVM regression tests
- **pb_tnc**: RFC 5793 PB-TNC batches, initially 6 batches derived from the strongSwan KVM regression tests
- **tls**: TLS messages (prefixed with 0x00 for server replies and 0x01 for client requests), initially 10 files derived from the strongSwan libtls unit tests

The `*-crash` directories contain input generated while fuzzing that caused crashes (or timeouts etc.).

The name of every file is the SHA-256 hash of its contents.
